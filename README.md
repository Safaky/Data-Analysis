# Data-Analysis

Hello, this study contains Z decay to electron and positron. 
Details coming...

We studied Z particle decay to electron and positron. We generated events simulation on Comphep and made hadronization with Delphes. Finally wrote a code to analyze it. You can find the code "Analysis.C"
